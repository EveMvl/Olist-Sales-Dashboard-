# Olist Sales Dashboard
👋 About
Hi! This project is part of my personal learning journey in data analytics. I used the public Olist e-commerce dataset (Brazil) and rebuilt it into a cleaner, analysis-ready version before designing an interactive sales dashboard in Tableau. 

🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to understand Olist’s sales performance from multiple perspectives: orders, customers, product categories, and payment behavior. Everything here is purely for learning and is not intended for commercial use.

🛠️ What I Worked On?
Here’s a snapshot of what I handled:
1. Merged the main Olist tables
   (orders, customers, order items, products, payments) into one clean dataset.
2. Cleaned 118K+ rows
   fixed missing values, standardized dates, and validated order–item links.
3. Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns
4. Designed a Tableau dashboard to highlight
   (revenue, orders, AOV, revenue trend by month, top 10 products, customer payment and distribution behavior)
   
📊 Key Insights
1. Revenue jumped +18% from Q3 → Q4 2017 (calculated as (Q4 – Q3) / Q3 × 100)
2. Credit cards dominate payment methods (~60% of transactions)
3. “cama_mesa_banho” is the top revenue-generating product category
4. Average freight cost is ~14% of product price
5. Most customers are located in the Southeast region of Brazil

🛠️ Skills & Tools
* Python (via Anaconda) – data cleaning & analysis
* Jupyter Notebook – documenting workflow
* SQL / PostgreSQL – exploring & merging tables
* Tableau – interactive dashboard
* GitHub – version control

🎯 Why This Project Matters?
This project was a hands-on introduction to working with real-world data. I explored raw data, cleaned and transformed it, extracted meaningful insights, and created a clear, easy-to-navigate dashboard. While the project is straightforward, it demonstrates curiosity combined with solid analytical thinking and dashboard design, as well as the ability to turn data into actionable insights.
